# Proof of Concurrency & Parallelism

This repository demonstrates **basic concurrency and parallelism concepts** in C with human-readable explanations, simple code, and numerical results.

## 1️⃣ Concepts Overview

### Concurrency
- **Definition:** Ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time (can be simulated on a single-core CPU).
- **Example:** Running a browser, music player, and file download simultaneously.
- **Key idea:** Tasks appear to run simultaneously, even if CPU switches between them.

### Parallelism
- **Definition:** True simultaneous execution of tasks using multiple CPU cores.
- **Example:** Multi-threaded programs using 4 cores to process data faster.
- **Key idea:** Hardware executes multiple threads at the same time to speed up computation.

## 2️⃣ Simple Proof of Concurrency

**Code Example (Single-threaded simulation):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

void taskA() {
    for (long i = 0; i < 100000000; i++);
}

void taskB() {
    for (long i = 0; i < 100000000; i++);
}

int main() {
    clock_t start = clock();

    taskA(); // runs first
    taskB(); // runs second

    clock_t end = clock();
    double time_taken = (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    printf("Total time (single-threaded): %.2f seconds\n", time_taken);
}
