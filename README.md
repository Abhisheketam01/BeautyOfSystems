# BeautyOfSystems

As a 19 year old computer Science and information technology student , my focus and interest is on SYSTEMS - understanding fundamentals deeply .
Thinking about how systems works , what is going on under the hood ? why behind everything . i think it makes lot of sense when we understand why something is working and required .
learning from books and internet , open for work , love to contribute in a Team.
thank you : )

# Beauty of Systems

This repository documents my journey into system engineering
through small, concrete experiments.

The goal is not to build products,
but to understand **why real systems work the way they do**.

## What this repo contains

- Hardware-aware experiments
- Performance observations
- System design intuition

## Experiments

- [Why Caches Matter](./caches)

## Philosophy

Every concept is proven with code, not memorized.
