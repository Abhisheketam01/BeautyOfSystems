# BeautyOfSystems

As a 19 year old computer Science and information technology student , my focus and interest is on SYSTEMS - understanding fundamentals deeply .
Thinking about how systems works , what is going on under the hood ? why behind everything . i think it makes lot of sense when we understand why something is working and required .
learning from books and internet , open for work , love to contribute in a Team.
thank you : )
